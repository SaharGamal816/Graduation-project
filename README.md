# AI-Powered Career Guidance System for Computer Science Students

## the Problem 
Selecting an academic or career path is a 
critical decision that profoundly shapes 
an individual's future, Student struggle to 
choose the right academic or career path 
not from lack of options, but because 
traditional guidance systems fail to 
provide personalized, data-driven, and 
adaptive recommendations. Current 
challenges include overwhelming 
information overload, generic advice that 
ignores individual strengths, rapidly 
shifting job markets, and unequal access 
to expert mentorship. This leads to 
widespread career uncertainty, skill 
mismatches, and unrealized potential 
highlighting the critical need for an 
intelligent, AI-powered guidance platform 
that delivers dynamic, tailored pathways 
for confident decision-making.

##Objective 
 The primary objectives of the Smart Path  
project are to develop an intelligent, user
centric career guidance system with the 
following goals:
 •Dynamic Timeline Generation: Utilize an 
AI agent and Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG) to create adaptive 
timelines reflecting current market trends 
and user preferences.
 •Intelligent Recommendation System: 
Leverage AI-driven recommendations to 
suggest optimal career tracks  based on 
individual inputs.
 •Interactive Support Features: Offer real
time assistance through answer question 
capabilities, track chat(community), and 
mentor connections to enhance user 
decision-making.
 • Educational Resource Curation: Deliver 
curated learning resources, including 
explore courses, to align user skills with 
career goals.

## Agentic AI 
Modern career guidance demands dynamic 
solutions. Traditional static roadmaps fail to address 
rapid industry evolution and personal variability. Our 
Smart Path AI Agent bridges this gap through a 
hybrid intelligence workflow that:
 Leverages stored knowledge (ChromaDB) for 
efficiency
 Validates real-time data (DuckDuckGo) for accuracy
 Delivers interactive planning (LLM-Q&A) for 
personalization
